Consider Two integers a and b taken as input from the user. Using Loops iterate the value of
a till the value of b.
If the value of a<=9 the output should correspond to the English representation of the
numbers i.e., 8=Eight, 9=Nine etc.
If the iteration exceeds 9 then the programs should print if the exceeded number is even or
odd.
