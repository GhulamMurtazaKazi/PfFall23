QUESTION # 5
In this C program, you are tasked with creating a function
called decideCarUsage that helps users decide whether they should use their car
on a particular day of the week. Users provide the numeric part of their car's
number and the day of the week (1 to 7). The program applies a simple rule:
even-numbered cars should be used on even days, and odd-numbered cars on odd
days. The function returns 1 if the car should be used and 0 if it should not.
