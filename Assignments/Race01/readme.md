Problem 1: Miles per hour to kilometers per seconds
Mr. Bhola does not know how to convert between miles/hour to kilometers/seconds. Write a program that asks for speed in miles/hour and outputs the speed in kilometers/seconds.![WhatsApp Image 2023-08-27 at 4 40 03 AM](https://github.com/GhulamMurtazaKazi/PfFall23/assets/142872097/d342493f-f178-4737-8cee-4449c0e85b89)

Problem 2: Even or Odd
Mr. Bhola does not know what an even or odd number is. He is least bothered to learn the difference either. It all comes down to your programming skills to write a program that will ask for a positive integer
greater than 0 and prints whether the number is even or odd. Be careful, Mr. Bhola can even enter 0 or negative numbers so your program must give an error saying invalid input in that case.

Problem 3: Adult or Minor
Given the age tell whether a person is an adult or minor. According to some laws in Pakistan, “’child’ means a person who, if a male, is under eighteen years of age, and if a female, is under sixteen years of
age.”

Problem 4: Bus fare
Mr. Bhola has acquired the post of a transport minister. Transport mafia has forced him to implement a complex bus fare method which benefits the transporters. Mr. Bhola (as you have by now known, that he is week in mathematics) is unable to calculate the fare correctly. The new fare calculation method
suggests that all adults pay a basic fare of PKR 10 and minors pay a basic fare of PKR 5. For every subsequent 5 km adults pay PKR 5/km and minors pay PKR 3/km (First 5km are free after paying basic fare). Adults and minors are determined by the definition in problem 2. Input to the program are traveler’s age, gender, and distance. Output is the total fare. Check for all invalid inputs (e.g., negative distance or age values).

Problem 5: Which Floor
There are 10 floors in a building 0 to 9. The building lift/elevator has 1 digit 7 segment LCD Panel display to tell which floor the lift is on, as shown. The input into the LCD Panel is a 7-digit long integer with only 1s and 0s. Each digit of the 7-digit long integer tells which panel to light or not to light from A to G respectively, where 1 means to light the panel and 0 means to keep it off.
E.g., 0110000 means only panel ‘B’ and ‘C’ are lit thus telling that this is the first floor. Similarly, the number 1111110 tells that all panels are lit except panel ‘G’ displaying the number 0. You need to write a program for a computer surveillance system to tell which floor the lift is on. The input for the program is the 7-digit integer compromising of only 1s and 0s. The output should be a single
digit integer 0 to 9 telling which floor the lift is on.
Hint: You can get the last digit by using %10 and the remaining digits by using integer division /10. Also, you only need branching to do it.
